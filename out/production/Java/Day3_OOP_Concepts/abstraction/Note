Abstraction in Java is the process of hiding internal implementation details and showing only essential functionality to the user.
It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.

    Java provides two ways to implement abstraction, which are listed below:
    - Abstract Classes (Partial Abstraction)
    - Interface (100% Abstraction)

Abstract Class
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods without body) as well as concrete methods (with implementation).

Interface
Interfaces is a blueprint of a class used to achieve 100% abstraction in Java.
It can contain abstract methods and constants but no method bodies (except default and static methods from Java 8 onward).
