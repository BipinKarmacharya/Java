What is the Collections Framework?
- Java Collection Framework (JCF) is a set of classes and interfaces that provide ready-made data structures to store and manipulate groups of objects efficiently.
- Replaces arrays in most modern Java code (because arrays are fixed size).

    - Java provides built-in collection classes like List, Set, Map and Queue, so developers don’t need to write their own data management algorithms.
    - The Collection Framework improves productivity by making code more reusable, maintainable and faster to develop.

Hierarchy:

    Collection (Interface)
    ├── List (Interface)
    │     ├── ArrayList
    │     └── LinkedList
    ├── Set (Interface)
    │     ├── HashSet
    │     └── TreeSet
    └── Map (Interface)
          ├── HashMap
          └── TreeMap


Notes:
    List → ordered, allows duplicates
    Set → unordered, no duplicates
    Map → key-value pairs
