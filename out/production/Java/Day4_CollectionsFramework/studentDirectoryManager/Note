Mini Project (1 hour)
🎯 Project: Student Directory Manager

Build a console app that:
Stores student names and IDs using HashMap.

Allows:
    - Adding a new student
    - Viewing all students
    - Searching a student by ID
    - Deleting a student

👉 Hint:
Use a Scanner for input and a HashMap<Integer, String> for storage.
