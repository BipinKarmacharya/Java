Encapsulation = wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together and controlling access.
    In Java:
        Make variables private
        Provide public getters/setters to access them

    Why use Encapsulation?
    - Prevents direct access to data (data hiding)
    - Maintains control over values
    - Improves security and reusability
