Method overloading in Java allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists, enabling compile-time (static) polymorphism.
Instead of defining two methods that should do the same thing, it is better to overload one.
Same method name but different parameters (type, number, or order).

The different ways of method overloading in Java are mentioned below:

1. Changing the Number of Parameters
Method overloading can be achieved by changing the number of parameters while passing to different methods.

    Explanation:
    - Two methods have the same name but different number of parameters.
    - Compiler selects the correct method based on how many arguments are passed.

2. Changing Data Types of Parameters
In many cases, methods can be considered overloaded if they have the same name but have different parameter types, methods are considered to be overloaded.

    Explanation:
    - Methods differ in parameter types (int vs double).
    - Compiler matches the method based on the exact data type of arguments.

3. Changing the Order of Parameters
Method overloading can also be implemented by rearranging the parameters of two or more overloaded methods.

    Explanation:
    - Methods have the same name but parameter order is different.
    - Compiler identifies which method to call based on sequence of arguments.

Note :  There can be a hybrid overloading also where number of parameters, type of parameters and order of parameters cam change in any combination.

    ** What if the Exact Prototype Does Not Match?
    Java tries type promotion in overloading
    - Convert to a higher type in the same hierarchy (e.g., byte -> int).
    - Convert to the next higher hierarchy if needed (e.g., int -> float).


If no suitable method is found, it causes a compilation error.
